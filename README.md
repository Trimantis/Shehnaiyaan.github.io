FEW POINTS TO KEEP IN MIND-

Make any necessary changes you might require in a branch.
DO NOT Make too many branches as it will become confusing.
Ensure that you have committed to your changes in the branch.
UPLOAD YOUR FINAL DOCUMENT TO THE MAIN BRANCH AFTER INTEGRATION.

NOTE- The project File Begins from the "Index" file. The parallax and registration forms have already been integrated.
